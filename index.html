    <div class="qa">
      <h3>1. What is Data Communication?</h3>
      <p>Data communication refers to the exchange of data between two devices through some form of transmission medium such as a wire cable or wireless channel.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>2. What are the key components of a data communication system?</h3>
      <p>Message, Sender, Receiver, Transmission medium, Protocol</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>3. What are protocols in networking?</h3>
      <p>Protocols are a set of rules that govern data communication — specifying how data is transmitted, formatted, and received.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>4. What is the difference between a Hub, Switch, and Router?</h3>
      <p>Hub: Broadcasts data to all ports (Layer 1)<br>Switch: Forwards data to specific MAC addresses (Layer 2)<br>Router: Forwards packets based on IP addresses (Layer 3)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>5. What are the layers of the OSI model?</h3>
      <p>Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>6. Which layer handles routing?</h3>
      <p>The Network layer (Layer 3) handles routing and logical addressing (IP).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>7. What is the main function of the Transport layer?</h3>
      <p>To provide reliable process-to-process data delivery (e.g., TCP, UDP).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>8. What are the main types of transmission media?</h3>
      <p>Guided: Twisted pair, coaxial cable, fiber optic<br>Unguided: Radio, microwave, infrared</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>9. What is the difference between TCP and UDP?</h3>
      <p>TCP: Connection-oriented, Reliable, Slower (HTTP, FTP)<br>UDP: Connectionless, Unreliable, Faster (DNS, VoIP)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>10. What is IP addressing?</h3>
      <p>IP addressing provides a unique logical address to each device on a network, enabling proper routing of packets.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>11. What is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6?</h3>
      <p>IPv4: 32 bits, Decimal format (192.168.1.1), ~4 billion addresses<br>IPv6: 128 bits, Hexadecimal format (2001:db8::1), Almost unlimited addresses</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>12. What is a subnet mask?</h3>
      <p>A subnet mask divides the IP address into network and host portions, determining the size of the network.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>13. What is a router?</h3>
      <p>A router is a device that connects multiple networks and forwards data packets based on IP addresses.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>14. What is the purpose of the routing table?</h3>
      <p>It stores paths and rules for forwarding packets to the correct destination network.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>15. What are static and dynamic routing?</h3>
      <p>Static Routing: Routes manually configured by the administrator.<br>Dynamic Routing: Routes learned automatically using routing protocols (e.g., RIP, OSPF, EIGRP).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>16. What is RIP (Routing Information Protocol)?</h3>
      <p>A distance-vector routing protocol that uses hop count as the metric and sends updates every 30 seconds.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>17. What is the maximum hop count allowed in RIP?</h3>
      <p>15 hops. A hop count of 16 means the destination is unreachable.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>18. What is OSPF?</h3>
      <p>Open Shortest Path First — a link-state routing protocol that uses Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>19. What are the differences between RIP and OSPF?</h3>
      <p>RIP: Distance Vector, Hop Count metric, Slow convergence, 15 hop limit<br>OSPF: Link State, Cost (Bandwidth) metric, Fast convergence, No hop limit</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>20. What is a default route?</h3>
      <p>A route used by the router when no other route matches the destination IP address.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>21. What is a gateway of last resort?</h3>
      <p>The router used as a last option to forward packets when no specific route is known — often configured as a default route.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>22. What is meant by "ping" in networking?</h3>
      <p>ping checks network connectivity by sending ICMP Echo Request packets and waiting for Echo Reply.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>23. What is ARP?</h3>
      <p>Address Resolution Protocol maps an IP address to its physical MAC address.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>24. What is DNS?</h3>
      <p>Domain Name System translates human-readable domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>25. What is DHCP?</h3>
      <p>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>26. What is NAT?</h3>
      <p>Network Address Translation converts private IP addresses to a public IP for internet communication.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>27. What is QoS in networking?</h3>
      <p>Quality of Service ensures priority for important traffic (like voice or video) to reduce latency and packet loss.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>28. What is the difference between unicast, multicast, and broadcast?</h3>
      <p>Unicast: One-to-one communication<br>Multicast: One-to-many selected nodes<br>Broadcast: One-to-all in the network</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>29. What is congestion in a network?</h3>
      <p>When the load on the network exceeds its capacity, leading to delay and packet loss.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
      <h3>30. What is meant by network topology?</h3>
      <p>The physical or logical arrangement of network devices — e.g., Bus, Star, Ring, Mesh, Hybrid.</p>
